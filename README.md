# Evaluate News NLP

This project allows users to evaluate the sentiment and other language features of news articles by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP). The application processes text input via the MeaningCloud API to provide detailed sentiment analysis, including polarity, confidence levels, and more. This is particularly useful for users who want to gauge the tone of news content quickly.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates how to build a full-stack web application using a combination of frontend and backend technologies. The backend handles API requests to the MeaningCloud NLP service and processes user input, while the frontend provides a simple interface for inputting news articles and displaying results.

### Features:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects the sentiment of a news article (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
- **Confidence Score**: Provides a confidence level of the analysis.
